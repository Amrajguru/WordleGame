Wordle Game Project Features so far:

- User has 3 chances to guess a random 4 letter word

- After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess

- After each guess, user sees the "correctness" of the guess

- After all guesses are taken, user can see the target word displayed

- User can tap a 'Reset' button to get a new word and clear previous guesses
